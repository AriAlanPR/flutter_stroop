# flutter_stroop

A Flutter project implementing a Stroop Effect game. This application challenges users to identify the ink color of a word, rather than the word itself, to test cognitive processing speed and accuracy. It utilizes Flutter for cross-platform development, Riverpod for state management, and Google Fonts for custom typography.

## Game Description

The Stroop Effect demonstrates interference in reaction time of a task. In this game, words like "RED", "GREEN", "BLUE", or "YELLOW" are displayed in conflicting ink colors (e.g., the word "RED" might be displayed in blue ink). The player must quickly identify the *ink color* and respond by swiping or using arrow keys in a specific direction:

*   **Red Ink:** Swipe Right / Right Arrow Key
*   **Green Ink:** Swipe Left / Left Arrow Key
*   **Blue Ink:** Swipe Up / Up Arrow Key
*   **Yellow Ink:** Swipe Down / Down Arrow Key

The game includes a timer, tracks the player's score, and provides immediate feedback on correct or incorrect answers, adjusting the score and time accordingly.
